#### <u>IMPORTANT</u>

In the settings of No Limits 2, go to controls and look for "dispatch". There you have to add the normal enter key as assigned key.

#### <u>How it works</u>

1. Download the server (ControlPanel_Server.zip) [here](https://github.com/Disembleergon/NL2_Control-Panel/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and run the .exe file on the PC you want to play on
2. Open [this website](https://priceless-curie-abbc39.netlify.app/) on the device you want to control the coaster with (your mobile phone for example)
3. Enter the IP-adress of your server and press connect (the server prints out the adress you have to enter)
4. Open No Limits 2 on your PC (don't close the server window)
5. Open a park and set the dispatch mode on manual
6. Control the roller coaster with the website and enjoy!

#### <u>Tip</u>

The server just presses the correct button on the keyboard when you press something on the control panel.
When you press both dispatch buttons for example, the server presses the enter key on the keyboard.
You can edit those keys in the actions.json file.
