### IMPORTANT

In the settings of No Limits 2, go to controls and look for "dispatch". There you have to add the normal enter key as assigned key.

To use the Control Panel, you have to download the LTS version of NodeJS on your PC:<br>
https://nodejs.org/en/

### How it works

1. Download the server [here](https://github.com/Disembleergon/NL2_Control-Panel/releases/tag/v1.0.2) (NL2_Control-Panel.zip)<br><br>
2. After you extracted the zip file and downloaded NodeJS, double click the `install.bat ` file to completely install the server (you only have to do this the first time)<br><br>
3. Double click the `launch_server.bat` file to start the server and the website<br><br>
4. The server now tells you the IP-adress and the website-URL. Enter the website-URL (for example 192.168.178.32:5000) into the browser of your device you want to control the coasters with (your mobile phone for example)<br><br>
5. On the website, enter the IP-adress of your server and press connect<br><br>
6. Open No Limits 2 on your PC (don't close the server window)<br><br>
7. Open a park and set the dispatch mode on manual<br><br>
8. Control the roller coaster with the website and enjoy!

### Tip

The server just presses the correct button on the keyboard when you press something on the control panel.
When you press both dispatch buttons for example, the server presses the enter key on the keyboard.
You can edit those keys in the actions.json file.
